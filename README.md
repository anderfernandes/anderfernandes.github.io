## Welcome!

Welcome to my website! Here you will see some of the stuff I work on. It has changes a lot in the past few years. Right now I'm dedicated web development, specially React and Node, though I get to do some Cold Fusion sometimes too.

### What am I gonna see here?

You will also see me write about music production on Linux, Role Playing Games like _Final Fantasy_ and _Tales of_ and teaching materials for my classes. Anything you see here you can use.

You can follow me on Twitter under the alias of [@anderfernandes](https://twitter.com/anderfernandes1). Enjoy!
