My name is Anderson Fernandes and I love full stack web development. My fascination with programming started when I was 10 and saw my dad doing Delphi and something I believe was the predecessor to Microsoft's .NET framework.

In my junior year in high school, I started attending tech school where I learned a lot of things. My first contact with web development was during the Spring of 2005, in a web design class. I fell in love with it. We started off doing it in notepad, then we moved to Macromedia Dreamweaver MX. Yes, Macromedia still owned Dreamweaver.
Throughout tech school, besides web design, I also learned Pascal and basic SQL. However, I did insist a little more with HTML and CSS by almost putting on the web a Megaman X website, my favorite game back then. I did end up working in some other website that I don't really remember.

I moved to the United States in the Spring of 2009 and at the end of that year is when I start doing it again. I did work with Wordpress until 2015, between making websites for friends, customers and for one of my favorite franchises: Gundam.

In 2013 I started doing front end development. I took over the website of the organization I work for, the Mayborn Science Theater. We went from a static site to a full fledged content management system using MuraCMS.

In 2016 I started doing full stack development to fill in the gaps in the organization I work for.

In the past couple of months I have done a lot of work in web development, including the Geekfest website, a fundraiser little con at Central Texas College and creating a brand new site for the Mayborn Science Theater using ColdFusion, React, PHP, Laravel, setting up virtual servers, web servers like Apache, IIS and nginx, databases like Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, MariaDB, MySQL and SQLite.

When I go home, I play JRPGs on my Playstation 3 and Playstation 4. Also, I mess around with being a musican and music production sometimes. I make the base sounds for the little play-everything duo Astron+55 and play the guitar. The cool thing about our little band is that the guy who sings was born and raised in Texas, but loves singing latin hits, specially Rock en Espa√±ol. We play a little bit of everything, from Pop to 80's, R&B and Latin.
